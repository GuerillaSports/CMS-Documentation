# Podcasts and Podcast Episodes

## Podcasts

A podcast is a collection of episodes surrounding a theme or topic.
For example, the Guerilla Sports' podcast *Hoops Your Daddy*
follows Liv Moods and her spicy takes thorough
her opinions on all things NBA and Denver Nuggets.

A podcast consists of five main components. Using *Hoops Your Daddy* as an example:

1. Name:
    - *Hoops Your Daddy*
2. Logo: a square SVG logo which identifies the podcast
<br/> <br/><img src="./hoops_your_daddy_logo.svg" height="100px" alt="Hoops your daddy logo" />
3. Title: Likely the same as the Name
    - *Hoops Your Daddy*
4. Description: A hook to entise and excite an audience
    - Liv Moods, and her classic spicy takes,
    gives her opinion on all things NBA and Denver Nuggets.
5. Metadata: a collection of information like sort-order and discoverable links
    - Spotify Link
    - Apple Link
    - Sort/Filter Order
    - Show On website: a switch which enables the
    podcast to show up as a filter on the Podcasts landing page:

// NOTE: Should move this to it's own section. The above content explains well enough how one should add a podcast.

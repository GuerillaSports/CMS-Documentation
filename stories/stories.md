# Stories and Story Episodes

## Story Types

Stories are a way to organize content into different categories.
Examples of different story types are:

- Post-game Report
- Practice Report
- Coach's Presser

Stories can be global, meaning they apply
to many different sports (i.e. Post-Game Report),
or they can be relative to a specific sport (i.e. Morning Skate).

Story Types consist of the following content:

- Name: the name of the story type.
The name should be broken into **two** parts for the next two components.
  - *Post-game Report*
  - Blue Text: Not always blue-text, however
this designates the top text colored by the
team color, or blue if no team is provided. (Note, that
for a Post-game report, a team should always be provided as
not to confuse the audience.)
    - Post-game

  - Outlined text: The 2nd half of the story type name.
    - Report

- Grouping: This may change in the future,
but should this type be grouped with other story-types
rather than with other stories of this type, provide
a grouping here
  - Game Report
    - This will allow you to group post-game and pre-game reports
    together, rather than grouping
    pre-game and post-game reports exclusivly.

## Story Episodes

These are simply stories which *optionally* employ a story-type.
**Stories are centered around a main video.**
Each story required a specific youtube video to be referenced.
Stories do not need a specific story-type, however,
story types provide stories with filtration, rich-thumnbnail images, and metadata.

### Stories with and without story-types
